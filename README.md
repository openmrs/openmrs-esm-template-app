# OpenMRS ESM Patient Billing Status App

This repository is for OpenMRS 3 to display the billing status of a patient on the patient chart
[OpenMRS Microfrontend](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+3.0%3A+A+Frontend+Framework+that+enables+collaboration+and+better+User+Experience).

## Running this code

```sh
yarn  # to install dependencies
yarn start  # to run the dev server
```

Once it is running, a browser window
should open with the OpenMRS 3 application. Log in and then navigate to `/openmrs/spa/root`.
