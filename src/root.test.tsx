/**
 * This is the root test for this page. It simply checks that the page
 * renders. If the components of your page are highly interdependent,
 * (e.g., if the `Root` component had state that communicated
 * information between `Greeter` and `PatientGetter`) then you might
 * want to do most of your testing here. If those components are
 * instead quite independent (as is the case in this example), then
 * it would make more sense to test those components independently.
 *
 * The key thing to remember, always, is: write tests that behave like
 * users. They should *look* for elements by their visual
 * characteristics, *interact* with them, and (mostly) *assert* based
 * on things that would be visually apparent to a user.
